## üõ†Ô∏è Execution Instructions

### Setup Instructions for GitHub Codespaces

Setting up MindGuard in GitHub Codespaces is straightforward with these steps:

1. **Open the repository in Codespaces**
   - Click the "Code" button on the repository page
   - Select the "Codespaces" tab
   - Click "Create codespace on main"

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install base requirements
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Install additional required packages
   pip install langchain-community faiss-cpu
   ```

3. **Set up your API keys**
   - Copy the example environment file
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Edit the `.env` file and add your API keys
     - You can use OpenAI, Google Gemini, or Groq (or any combination)
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key-here
     GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key-here
     ```

4. **[Optional] Download models for offline use**
   - If you want to use the application in an environment with limited connectivity:
     ```bash
     python download_models.py
     ```
   - This will download the emotion analysis model for offline use

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Installation Issues

If you encounter the error about missing `langchain_community`:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: Module langchain_community.vectorstores not found
```

Run the following command:
```bash
pip install langchain-community
```

If you see an error about importing `ConversationBufferMemory`:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'ConversationBufferMemory' from 'langchain_community.memory'
```

The code has been updated to use the correct import. Make sure to pull the latest changes or manually update the import in `agent/memory.py`:
```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory  # correct import for latest LangChain version
```

You may also need to install the base LangChain package:
```bash
pip install langchain
```

For FAISS related errors:
```bash
pip install faiss-cpu
```

If you need to update your LangChain installation:
```bash
pip install -U langchain langchain-community langchain-core
```

For Gemini integration issues:
```
ValueError: "ChatGemini" object has no field "generation_config"
```
This has been fixed in the latest code. If you're still experiencing this, update your codespace with the latest changes.

#### Groq Model Issues

If you see an error like:
```
Error code: 404 - {'error': {'message': 'The model `llama2-70b-4096` does not exist or you do not have access to it.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'model_not_found'}}
```

The code has been updated to use the current Groq model `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`. If you're still experiencing this error, check the latest available models in Groq's documentation.

#### Offline Mode Issues

If you see a warning about the emotion analyzer:
```
Warning: Could not load emotion analyzer: We couldn't connect to 'https://huggingface.co'...
```

The application will automatically fall back to an enhanced rule-based emotion detection system. For optimal offline usage, download the models in advance:

```bash
python download_models.py
```

This will save the models to the `./cached_models` directory, allowing the application to use them even without internet access.

#### API Connection Issues

The application now has improved error handling for API issues:

1. It will attempt to automatically switch between providers if one fails
2. If OpenAI API fails, it will try to use Gemini API if configured
3. If Gemini API fails, it will try to use OpenAI API if configured

You can see which provider is being used in the welcome message when starting the application.

## üß† Technical Architecture

<img width="618" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 3 17 29 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79226b0a-4686-4124-8fc0-927ffcb8aea6" />

The application uses a flexible, modular architecture:

1. **LangGraph-Based Workflow**:
   - Enhanced node sequence with specialized processing steps
   - Conditional routing based on emotional analysis
   - Stateful conversation management

2. **AI and ML Components**:
   - **EmotionAnalyzer**: Transformer-based emotion detection with rule-based fallback
   - **MoodTracker**: Pattern recognition and insight generation from mood history
   - **TherapeuticModalities**: Smart recommendation system for therapeutic resources
   - **Memory System**: FAISS vector store for conversation history

3. **Engagement and Personalization**:
   - **GamificationSystem**: Achievements, streaks, and rewards for user engagement
   - **Adaptive Response Generation**: Tailored therapeutic responses based on emotional state

4. **Provider Flexibility**:
   - **LLMFactory**: Creates appropriate LLM instances based on available providers
   - **Intelligent Fallback**: Automatically switches between providers if one fails

### Enhanced Workflow Architecture
The MindGuard workflow follows these key steps:

1. **Safety Check**: Detects crisis keywords and PII
2. **Emotional Assessment**: Analyzes text for emotional content
3. **Mood Tracking**: Records emotional data and generates insights
4. **Therapeutic Recommendations**: Suggests appropriate modalities
5. **Clinical Response**: Generates therapeutic response with recommendations
6. **Gamification Update**: Records activities and provides engagement incentives
7. **Crisis Escalation**: Activates emergency protocol when needed

### Provider Priority
When multiple API keys are configured, the application uses the following priority order:
1. OpenAI (fastest response times)
2. Groq (high quality with Llama models)
3. Google Gemini (good balance of features)

## üí¨ Conversation Showcase
**User**: *"I can't stop thinking about ending it all"*  
**Assistant**:  
```
üö® Crisis Protocol Activated üö®  
1. Auto-connected to National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (988)  
2. Shared your location with emergency contacts  
3. Grounding exercise initiated:  
   "Name 5 blue things you can see..."  

[Post-Crisis] Follow-up scheduled in 24 hours  
```

**User**: *"Everything I do fails"*  
**Assistant**:  
```
[Emotion Detected: Hopelessness (0.91)]  
Let's examine this thought:  
1. What's the evidence for/against this?  
2. Alternative perspective: When did you last succeed?  
[Memory Recall] You helped your neighbor on 3/15 - that mattered
